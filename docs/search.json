    "text": "what excites me.\nI am deeply excited by the idea of proteins as technology; truly nanoscale, biocompatible, programmable and reproducible machines. I want to harness the power of proteins to generate new technologies, both for reducing human suffering and for reducing our impact on the environment. This is what drives me.\nI completed my PhD in structural biology in order to understand proteins at the most fundamental level. I completed my postdoc in protein engineering in order to learn how to make new, useful proteins.\nAlong the way, I’ve built a lot of skills. Here is a short list of my technical skillsets:\n\nComputational: Python (Jupyter, Pandas, etc.), AlphaFold2, Rosetta Suite (Match, EnzymeDesign, RoseTTAFold2NA, etc.), SciKitLearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow2/Keras, PyMOL, crystallographic software.\nExperimental: protein expression, protein purification, construct/plasmid design, biochemical analyses, tissue culture, x-ray crystallography, membrane proteins (GPCRs, ion channels), nanobodies (including binding kinetics), small molecule studies, flow cytometry, patch-clamp electrophysiology.\nManagerial: project management, inclusive mentoring, dialogue facilitation, oral & written communication skills."

    "text": "where I’ve been.\nBetween 2020-2023, I was Co-Chair of the SURPAS Long Range Planning Committee. This work culminated in the publication of the SURPAS Long Range Planning Report 2023.\nBetween 2018-2023, I have been a postdoc in the Deisseroth Lab at Stanford University. I engineered novel properties into light-activated ion channel proteins, such as ChRmine (Kishi … Byrne et al., Cell 2022) and KCR1 & 2 (Tajima, … Byrne et al., bioRxiv 2022). These new tools will be used to deepen our understanding of neural circuitry in the mammalian brain.\nIn 2019, I completed the Stanford Ignite entrepreneurship program at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and developed a venture pitch for machine-learning-enabled completion of electronic medical records.\nI received my DPhil. from the University of Oxford in 2018 with Christian Siebold. I uncovered molecular mechanisms of Hedgehog signal transduction by solving several crystal structures of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened, complexed to different small molecules (Byrne et al., Nature 2016). We discovered that cholesterol is a Smoothened agonist (Luchetti… Byrne et al., eLife 2016) and that multiple ligand binding sites regulate Smoothened (Byrne et al., Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2018).\nAs an undergrad, I worked with Matthew Call and Melissa Call at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research (WEHI) in Melbourne, Australia, to reveal the transmembrane determinants of ligand recognition for the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH9 (Tan, Byrne et al., J Biol Chem. 2019).\nI am committed to justice, equity, diversity and inclusion work. I am a co-facilitator of the CCC&AOP program at Stanford. In my free time, I love going rock climbing. Ask me about it!"
